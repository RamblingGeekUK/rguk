I'm really intrigued by Microsoft's new browser, Spartan.  Here's the first video (as far as I'm aware) of it.  It looks really nice and I'm hoping the hate for IE will die along with the browser. I really want this to be an hit for Microsoft, for this top happen they need to do two things.

Add-In's, this is needed, I really love the fact that I can have a SSH client with Chrome. Microsoft have said it's coming, I hope it comes sooner rather than later.

Release it for Windows 7, if they don't do this then it's a massive mistake, just release it with out Windows 10 features like Cortana.

I think this looks really nice!
