Yesterday I spoke about losing data at a customers site....  Well it was indeed lost.  Which wasn't great as you can imagine.  Thankfully the customer was very understanding all things considered.

We managed to part restore some data into the database and reset the stock values, it's now down to them to carry out a stock take and update those values and they should be up and running again, albeit without any history, I do suspect that it was all a little to easy and I think as time goes on that there will be more problems with this site because of this, I am hoping to be proved wrong.

So I left site feeling that we had done all we could had done in a bad situation, so hopefully this will be chalked up to experience for all concerned.

This is the second post as in as many days, I have no idea what's going on! :-)  At this moment in time, I'm finding blogging therapeutic.  I know many won't understand why bother, but in true geek style, I don't care.

I think the other reason, I've started blogging this week as I'm hoping to blog about our wedding and adventures in Florida in the coming weeks, I'm not sure when or even if I'm going to have time to blog ever single day, but I'm going to do my best, assuming the future wife will allow it! :-)

It's funning once I start typing I start to want to talk about all kinds of stuff, I just been reading [Paul Thurrott's blog](http://www.winsupersite.com/) about [Amazon's Kindle](http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/kindle.asp) after reading that, I wish I had one for the flights for the coming weeks, as I've found in the pass few years that I really enjoying reading and I think this device sounds quite useful and it would be a new gadget to play with of course :-)  As usual it's not available in the UK as of yet, just like the Zune!

It is of course difficult knowing how much to share on a public blog,I guess I will have to buy [Scoble's](http://scobleizer.com/) [book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/047174719X?tag=nakedconversa-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=047174719X&adid=0KYBWJPM4FHMFHGHMXYP&) about blogging.... to see what insights I can get.

I'm using Microsoft's [Windows Live Writer](http://get.live.com/writer/overview) to blog this and I must say, I'm loving it!
