I haven’t done a “proper” post on here in a while.  There’s been a lot going on for me, moving house and having a poorly baby boy, he’s well now.

That’s not to say I’ve not been keeping in touch with the latest news, as you may of noticed, I did post some videos of Windows Phone.

There’s so much going on at the moment from Windows 8, Windows 2012, SQL Server, Office 2013, Xbox Dashboard update and of course Microsoft have released there own tablet, the Microsoft Surface RT and I have purchased one, which deserves its own post, for my own thoughts on that device.

So lots of software and devices to install and play around with and of course there’s the SDK’s to take a look at as well.

There was also the shock announcement from Microsoft, regarding the departure of Sinofsky, just weeks after Windows 8 shipped, from what I have watched and read this appears to be the correct move for Microsoft.

Apple release the iPad Mini as well as updating most of there products, including a New iPad just a few months after the last update.

The Nexus range of devices from Google, with the [Nexus 10](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/tablets/378280/nexus-10) looking like a very compelling product.

Then there’s the crazy situation with [John McAfee](http://www.whoismcafee.com/watchfulness/) and HP’s write down on UK company Autonomy.

I feel like I’m just scratching the surface (no pun intended), with what's been going on lately.   So as you can see I’m still here and I’ve not gone inactive.   

Once I start to sit down and look at this stuff more posts will appear on a regular basis again, until next time………
