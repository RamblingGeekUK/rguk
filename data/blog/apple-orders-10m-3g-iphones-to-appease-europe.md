When Apple announced that it would be bring support to Exchange ActiveSync to the iPhone, I'll admit I was tempted, after a little thought thou, I would be giving up the following.

1. £250
2. 3G/HSPA Support
3. Our Orange contract allows us to make free calls to each other on our business plan

So if this is True and no one will know if this is true until Apple announces it is.  Then that would be two of my 3 ticked.  If Apple really wants to increase sales, the allow us to purchase from what ever supplier we like.....
