This blog started life being hosted on the Word Press servers for ease.  I’m now getting to a stage that I want to do move stuff and their restrictions are stopping me.

So last night I found a host namely [www.tsohost.co.uk](http://www.tsohost.co.uk) , which is only £14.99 for the year!  £1.25 a month :-)

I’ve been updating the blog his morning and it seems really fast as well.  So I’m really happy with the cost, performance and the refreshed look to the site as well.

Now I just need to go and create all of the content :-)
