I haven’t had chance to post much of lot as a lot has been going on.  Unfortunately at this time I can’t speak about it just yet.  Most of my time has been consumed with family affairs and working on a ASP.NET web application. 

I will blog more about the experiences that I have had developing the database over the coming weeks.

Sorry to be vague, I just thought I needed to post something so you know that I was still active.  ![Smile](http://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wlEmoticonsmile.png)
