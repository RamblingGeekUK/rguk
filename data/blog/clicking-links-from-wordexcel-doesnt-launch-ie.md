Had an irritating issue, when clicking http links from within Word and else where, you receive something like :

"This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this computer"

"Your organization's policies are preventing us from completing this action for you. For more info, please contact your help desk."

This appears to happen after Chrome has been uninstalled.  You can go into the regsitery and update the correct key, etc.  I found a handy Microsoft Article, [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310049](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310049).
