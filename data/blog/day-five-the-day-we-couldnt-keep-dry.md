Today we went to universal island of adventures.  We got there around 10:30ish.   We should of met Tracy, Alan, Pat and Jimmy for 9:30, but it took ages for us to get though the tick booths.

When we walked in there was a huge ride called the Hulk!  So for some insane reason we deiced to go on that straight away.  So me, Lisa, Sam, Ellen, Mat, Laura, Jimmy and Tracy all queued or rather we walked on as there was no queue.  We all sat there and the cars moved forward as expected and then start to be pulled up an incline, which is normal then out of no where, the thing shot forward and we were off.... it seemed to go on for ages, other than that I can't remember much more, too bust pooing my pants! :-)

These images don't really so the size of the the ride, but it was huge!

We all then went on the Spiderman 3D ride.  This was cool!  You sat in a car you put some 3D glasses on and then a story was played out in 3D with Spidy landing on the front of the car and the car would move to simulate his weight hitting the front, it was done really well.

We got some lunch.

Next was the rapids, which we all went on, and we came of drenched!  Soaked from top to bottom, it was wasn't even a hot day!  As we were all soaked we went on the log flume next, all of the girls (apart from Pat) in one log and the lads in another, me and Sam were behind Big Al, so we didn't get that wet, until the end when the kids soaks us from a bridge with water guns.

We then went on Jurassic Park ride, which was another wet ride!  To me this looked a bit like oblivion in Alton Towers a  huge drop looking at, it wasn't a coaster as such, it kind of went up and down and made you believe you were in trouble, then the drop, which wasn't that bad then a huge splash at the end!

That was the last wet ride... or so we thought.  So we all decided to go buy some new cloths to get dry, which most of us did.  This took about an hour.   We had some lunch then went to watch the Sinbad show, which was a bit poo.

We went on a ride called Journey to Atlantis, which was poo.  We then went on two other coasters called dual of the dragons, these were two separate rides but they intertwined each other, they were very similar to nemesis in Alton Towers.

Sam, Ellen, Mat and Laura wanted to go on Spiderman again, which they did and the rest of us went to get a drink in a coffee shop, whilst in there, waiting for them to come back, it start raining and raining hard, we waited 10mins but it didn't appear to be stopping any time soon, so we decided to start walking towards the car park, yes we got wet again!
