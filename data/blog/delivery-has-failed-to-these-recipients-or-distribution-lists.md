When customers were trying to e-mail us they were receiving the above error back.

Delivery has failed to these recipients or distribution lists

[alias@domain.com](mailto:alias@domain.com) Your message wasn't delivered because of security policies. Microsoft Exchange will not try to redeliver this message for you. Please provide the following diagnostic text to your system administrator

After a little investigation.   We have a mailbox which forwards the e-mail to an distribution group.  On the distribution group the Require that all senders are authenticated option was checked.  Unchecking this resolved the issue.
