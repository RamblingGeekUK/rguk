The past 12 months have been a one of the most difficult times of my life.  I'm not sure if I should go into the details here or any where else on the Web.   One thing the Web has done over the last decade is change what people say in public, what was once kept for close friends is now posted all over social media.  My Mum used to say don't wash your dirty laundry in public and yet whilst at the time that made a lot of sense to me and to some extent it still does, it seems at odds with the new world we live in.  I guess at the end of the day, it's a personal choice how much to share or not share, difficult when your a very honest and open person as I am.

This post goes against the normal type of content I would post.  I wanted to at least acknowledge that my blog and various sites have taken a backseat.  I hope to start rectifying that and I intend to start a new blog over at [www.kryptos.co.uk](http://kryptos.co.uk) for more personal posts.

Thanks, Wayne
