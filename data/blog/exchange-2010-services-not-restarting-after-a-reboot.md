I have noticed when a SBS 2007/2011 server restarts, the Exchange Services don’t always restart.  However when you start them manually it’s fine.   It would appear that Microsoft have issued a fix for this issue, the issue seems to be related to Exchange 2010 being installed on a Global Catalogue server.
