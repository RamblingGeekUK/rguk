I hope you all had a good one.  My own was OK, spent the entire holiday ill with flu and still trying to get over it now.

I have just noticed that I haven’t blogged in over a month now.  I shall try and be better in the coming weeks and months to blog more.

In fact I couldn’t login to make this post and had to connect to the database to check the e-mail address and amend so that I could send the password reset e-mail.  ![Smile](http://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wlEmoticon-smile.png)

This is going to be a scary and exciting year to come for me and my other half as we are expecting are first baby. ![Winking smile](http://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png)

Have a good new year and I hope it brings all that you could wish for.
