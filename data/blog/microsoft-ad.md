Here's the next ad from Microsoft [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ "http://www.microsoft.com/windows/")

I'm still not 100% sure what it's about, but it seems trying to say Microsoft is reconnecting with the everyday user/consumer.... still fun thou.

I believe the UK ads are to be aired soon also....
