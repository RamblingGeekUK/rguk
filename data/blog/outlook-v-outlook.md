Microsoft are in the process of moving the current Outlook back-end over to what I think it is Exchange/Azure back-end. They have said that this would be completed by the end of the summer.   I have just checked mine and it hasn't yet moved over.

It's difficult to tell the difference, however, the new one look has "Outlook Email" rather than "Outlook.com" and the new button is lower on the updated version, also if you go into Options, you will see lots of more options and if you have used Exchange Management Console (this will look/feel) familiar.
