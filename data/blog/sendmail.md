So this past weekend I've been paying some attention to this site and I noticed there has been a few downloads of SendMail an app I  wrote 8 years ago to send mail from the command line. 

At the time this was difficult and in that time since then a lot has changed.  The app was wrote for my own usage really and I made it avaiable publicy as an convenice.  
  
I downloaded it and tested it and basically it no longer works because of TLS etc.

So I have pulled the app and it will not longer available. 

Of course sending email from the command line may still be a need, this can be achived with PowerShell.

See the Microsoft Docs : [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/send-mailmessage?view=powershell-6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/send-mailmessage?view=powershell-6)
