I was going to blog about my thoughts on Windows 8, then I thought I didn’t want to re-blog, what Microsoft was blogging, I see little point.   Instead I thought I would wait for the Beta or as Microsoft is calling it, the Consumer Preview. 

Once I’ve has chance to play around, I shall blog about my own thoughts, good and bad. ![Smile](http://ramblinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png)
